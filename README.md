# WorkOutTracker

An Android app designed to keep track of common workouts or own custom ones. Users will not need to log in to make use of the app, as they will be able to watch the list of global exercises, the Guest Mode. The list of global exercises can only be edited by an admin user. 
Stopwatch and timer features are available no login needed, and it can be minimized.
Users that have signed in will be able to access the same as guest ones. Also, for them, there will be available a list of custom exercises in which the users will be able to add new ones just for themselves. Those will be uploaded to the cloud on Firebase, and only own exercises will be able to be removed.
Exercises will have a description and picture stored in Firebase. 


## Technologies
