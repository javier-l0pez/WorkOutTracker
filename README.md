# WorkOutTracker

An Android app designed to keep track of common workouts or create own custom exercises, and use a timer to know how long should you keep working out or resting.
Users will need to log in to make use of the app; once logged in normal users will be able to watch the list of global exercises but not edit it, while admins will be able to edit it, that's the "Workout List" screen. The list of custom exercises will be editable by everyone, and every user will have their own. 
Stopwatch and timer features will be accessed from a button on the top right corner.
The exercise and user database is stored in Firebase. An admin account can only be created through access to the database itself.
Users will be able to update their profile, changing their profile picture, and password. Also they will be able to delete their account.
A timer is also available from the top right corner, so the user can track how long have them worked out that exercise, or to track for how long do they rest between workouts.
